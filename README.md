## Overview

This project is a CSS-based solution for the Chat App CSS Illustration challenge by Frontend Mentor. The goal was to recreate a visually appealing chat app interface using HTML and CSS while ensuring responsiveness across various device sizes. The challenge also included an optional feature to animate the chat interface during the initial load, which adds an engaging touch to the design.

The solution emphasizes clean, semantic markup and modern CSS techniques, such as Flexbox and Grid, to create a responsive and user-friendly layout. This project follows a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal performance and usability on smaller screens before scaling up to larger ones.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
